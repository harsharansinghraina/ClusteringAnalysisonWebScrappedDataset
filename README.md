# Amazon Bestsellers Data Analysis and Clustering

## Overview

This project analyzes Amazon Bestsellers data through web scraping, data wrangling, visualization, and unsupervised machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to explore the data, handle outliers, and discover clusters using K-Means and Mean-Shift clustering algorithms.

## Features

- **Web Scraping:** Data scraped from Amazon using BeautifulSoup.
- **Data Wrangling:** Conversion of data types and handling of missing values.
- **Visualization:** Insights gained through histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
- **Outlier Handling:** Techniques like trimming, quantile-based flooring and capping, and logarithmic transformation.
- **Clustering:** Application of K-Means and Mean-Shift algorithms to identify meaningful clusters.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/amazon-bestsellers-clustering.git
   cd amazon-bestsellers-clustering
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Analysis:**
   Open and run the Jupyter notebook provided in the repository to perform the analysis and clustering.

## Usage

- **Data Scraping:** Extracts data from Amazon and stores it in a CSV file.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Perform data wrangling, visualize the dataset, and handle outliers.
- **Clustering:** Execute K-Means and Mean-Shift clustering to group the products into distinct clusters.
